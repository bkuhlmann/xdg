# 2.2.5 (2019-05-21)

- Fixed a gem packaging issue where the `index` file from the 2.2.3 implementation was missing which
  caused `LoadError` issues for downstream projects.
- No official Git tag was used for this release due to not having write access to the original
  [XDG](https://github.com/rubyworks/xdg) project so this release is only available via
  [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/xdg/versions/2.2.5).

# 2.2.4 (2019-05-21)

- For all versions prior to 2.2.4 please see the original XDG project
[HISTORY](https://github.com/rubyworks/xdg/blob/master/HISTORY.md). The release of 2.2.4 marked the
beginning of new ownership of the XDG gem which this project documents starting with the release of
2.2.4.
- Added a post install message for the gem warning everyone of the upcoming 3.0.0 release with major
  breaking changes to the API.
- No official Git tag was used for this release due to not having write access to the original
  [XDG](https://github.com/rubyworks/xdg) project so this release is only available via
  [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/xdg/versions/2.2.4).
